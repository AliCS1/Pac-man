# Pac-man
In Progress Pac-man game, will implement the AI soon.

The "PacMan V1" file has the incomplete game of Pac-man, the player can move around the map and interact with the walls.

The map was created by me, using the "PacManMapCreater" python file I made. I created this python script to allow me to create a map through clicking tiles to select whether there is a wall on that tile or not.

WILL COMPLETE THIS GAME ONCE I HAVE TIME.
